    - message: >
        Introduced a new database table task_scheduled_adhoc to store scheduling information for scheduled ad hoc tasks.
        Added a new bridge class scheduled_adhoc_task to calculate execution times for scheduled ad hoc tasks.
        Registered three new scheduled ad hoc tasks in public/lib/db/tasks.php:
          core\task\asynchronous_backup_task
          core\task\asynchronous_copy_task
          core\task\asynchronous_restore_task
        Updated the \core\task\manager class to support scheduling of scheduled ad hoc tasks.
